Project Title: Unsupervised Segmentation of Forest Fire Images via Convolutional Autoencoder
This project implements an unsupervised learning approach using a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) for segmenting wildfire regions in forest images. Leveraging Channel Attention and Cluster Mask Enhancer modules, the model identifies fire-prone areas by clustering latent space features via K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Color-aware regularization enhances focus on fire-specific features, achieving high segmentation accuracy on the Corsican Fire Dataset with an IoU of 0.8398 and DICE score of 0.8998. Future work will explore a real-time video-based extension for continuous wildfire monitoring.
